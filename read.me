Hey, I've created a To-Do List App, it is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help you manage your tasks efficiently. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app leverages the Document Object Model (DOM) to provide a seamless 
user experience. The user-friendly interface allows you to easily add, edit, and delete tasks, while dynamic task management ensures that tasks are updated in real-time without the need for page refreshes. 
The app supports task prioritization, categorization, and completion with just a click, making it easy to stay organized. Additionally, its responsive design ensures that it works beautifully on any device, 
whether youâ€™re using a desktop, tablet, or smartphone. With persistent local data storage, you can close the app and return later without losing any of your important tasks.
